description: "线性模型理论及其应用，特别是各个模型的适用范围、参数估计方法、模型检验和诊断，重视理论和算法实现的并重，同时附以真实的案例分析。恪守所有的模型都是线性模型的原则，将线性模型、广义线性模型、广义可加模型、线性混合效应模型、广义线性混合效应模型和广义可加混合效应模型融合到同一框架下。应用层面，我们还要考虑数据集的平衡问题、缺失问题和异常问题。应用场景包括环境污染、流行病学和风险控制等领域。"

\index{置信区间}
\index{信仰区间}
\index{统计功效}

可以说，点估计、区间估计、假设检验、统计功效是每一个学数理统计的学生都绕不过去的坎，离开学校从事数据相关的工作，它们仍然是必备的工具。所以，本书会覆盖相关内容，但是和高校的教材最大的区别是更加注重它们之间的区别和联系，毕竟每一个统计概念都是经过了千锤百炼，而我们的主流教材始终如一地遵循的一个基本套路，就是突然给出一大堆定义、命题或定理，紧接着冗长的证明过程，然后给出一些难以找到实际应用背景的例子。三板斧抡完后就是给学生布置大量的习题，这种教学方式无论对于立志从事理论工作的还是将来投身于工业界的学生都是不合适的。

> 极大似然估计最初由德国数据学家 Gauss 于 1821 年提出，但未得到重视，后来， R. A. Fisher 在 1922 年再次提出极大似然的思想，探讨了它的性质，使它得到广泛的研究和应用。[@Prob_2006_Mao]

这是国内某著名数理统计教材在极大似然估计开篇第一段的内容，后面是各种定义、定理、公式推导。教材简短一句话，这里面有很多信息值得发散，一个数学家提出了统计学领域极其重要的一个核心思想，他是在研究什么的时候提出了这个想法，为什么后来没有得到重视，整整 100 年以后，Fisher 又是怎么提出这一思想的呢？他做了什么使得这个思想被广泛接受和应用？虽然这可能有点离题，但是读者可以获得很多别的启迪，要知道统计领域核心概念的形成绝不是一蹴而就的，这一点也绝不局限于统计科学，任何一门科学都是这样的，比如物理学之于光的波粒二象性。历史上，各门各派的学者历经多年的思想碰撞才最终沉淀出现在的结晶。笔者认为，学校要想培养出有原创理论创新的人才，在对待前辈的成果上，我们要不吝笔墨和口水，传道不等于满堂灌和刷分机，用寥寥数节课或者数页纸来梳理学者们几十年乃至上百年的智慧结晶是非常值得的，我们甚至可以从当时的社会、人文去剖析。非常欣赏有人在收集关于统计学历史的材料，读者不妨去看看 <https://github.com/sctyner/history_of_statistics>。 另一个不得不提的人是 [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/)，她以风趣幽默的漫画形式，以画龙点睛之手法勾勒出基本的统计概念和思想，详见 <https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations>，是我见过最好的科普读物。

\index{统计分布}

Bradley Efron 在他的课程中谈及现代统计的研究层次，第一层次是基于正态分布假设的，这种类型已经研究的很清楚了，往往可以得到精确的结果，第二层次是将正态分布推广到指数族，这种类型的也研究的比较多了，常见的情况都研究的比较清楚，罕见的情况也是大量存在的，特别是在实际应用当中，总的来说只能得到部分准确的结果，第三层次对分布没有任何限定，只要满足成为一个统计分布的条件，这种情况下就只能求助于一般的数学工具和渐进理论。

\index{区间估计}

下面以区间估计为例，希望能为传道做一点事情。区间估计的意义是解决点估计可靠性问题，它用置信系数解决了对估计结果的信心问题，弥补了点估计的不足。置信系数是最大的置信水平。


1934 年 C. J. Clopper 和 E. S. Pearson 给出二项分布 $B(n, p)$ 参数 $p$ 的置信带 [@Test_1934_binom]，图 \@ref(fig:confidence-belt) 提炼了文章的主要结果。

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="index_files/figure-html/confidence-belt-1.png" alt="(ref:confidence-belt)" width="480" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:confidence-belt)(ref:confidence-belt)</p>
</div>

(ref:confidence-belt) 给定置信系数 $1- \alpha = 0.95$ 和样本量 $n = 10$ 的情况下，二项分布参数 $p$ 的置信带。样本量为 10，正面朝上的次数为 2，置信水平为 0.95 的情况下，参数 $p$ 的精确区间估计为 $(p_1, p_2) = (0.03, 0.55)$。

(ref:confidence-belt-s) 二项分布参数 $p$ 的置信带

区间半径这么长，区间估计的意义何在？增加样本量可以使得半径更短，那么至少应该有多少样本量才可以让估计变得有意义呢？就是说用估计比不用估计更好呢？答案是 39 个，留给读者思考一下为什么？读者可能已经注意到，置信带是关于点 $(5, 0.5)$ 中心对称的，这又是为什么，并且两头窄中间胖，像个酒桶？

实际达到的置信度水平随真实的未知参数值和样本量的变化而**剧烈**波动，这意味着这种参数估计方法在实际应用中不可靠、真实场景中参数真值是永远未知的，样本量是可控的，并且是可以变化的。根本原因在于这类分布是离散的，比如这里的二项分布。当数据 $x$ 是离散的情况，置信区间的端点$\ell(x)$ 和 $u(x)$ 也是离散的。这种缺陷是无法避免的，清晰的置信区间和离散的数据之间存在无法调和的冲突。

覆盖概率 $P_{\theta}(X = x)$ 和参数真值 $\theta$ 的关系 [@Lawrence2001;@Geyer2005]

比如总体为二项分布 $B(n, \theta)$ 其中 n = 10，在置信水平 $\alpha = 0.95$ 下，问参数 $\theta$ 的覆盖概率是多少？随参数 $\theta$ 的变化情况如何？<https://d.cosx.org/d/421502-coverage-probability>

还是以抛硬币的为例，我来做这个实验，抛10次，获得 7 次正面向上，他做这个实验，10 次中 4 次正面，每个人来做这个实验可能都会有所不同，实际上有 2^10  = 1024 个结果（含位置变化），每个结果都可以用来估计未知的参数 $p$ 及其置信区间，和相应的覆盖概率。

## 本书定位 {#sec:audience .unnumbered}

学习本书需要读者具备基本的概率、统计知识，比如上过一学期的概率论和数理统计学，也需要读者接触过编程知识，比如至少上过一学期的 C 语言、Python 语言或 Matlab 语言。了解基本的线性代数，比如矩阵的加、减、乘、逆四则运算、线性子空间、矩阵的 LU、SVD、Eigen 等分解。

## 内容概要 {#sec:abstract .unnumbered}

第 \@ref(chap:preface) 章介绍本书的写作背景、语言环境、全书的记号约定、如何获取帮助、作者简介等信息。

第 \@ref(chap:notations) 章介绍全书的数学公式符号。

第 \@ref(chap:file-operations) 章介绍文件操作。

第 \@ref(chap:data-structure) 章介绍 R 语言的数据结构。

第 \@ref(chap:data-manipulation) 章介绍数据操作，包括 Base R 、**data.table** 和 **magrittr**。

第 \@ref(chap:data-transportation) 章介绍数据导入导出， **data.table** 之于 csv 文件， **openxlsx** 之于 xlsx 文件。

第 \@ref(chap:data-visualization) 章介绍数据可视化，分四个部分，基础元素、常用图形、字体和颜色设置。

第 \@ref(chap:dynamic-documents) 章介绍动态文档，即 R Markdown 及其生态系统。

第 \@ref(chap:interactive-web-graphics) 章介绍交互式网页图形，以常用的 **plotly** 和 **highcharter** 为主，重点介绍 R 和 JavaScript 库的对应关系。

第 \@ref(chap:interactive-data-tables) 章介绍交互式数据表格，分两节介绍交互式的 **DT** 和 **reactable**，静态的 **gt** 和 **kableExtra**，掌握这几个 R 包足以应付日常工作。

第 \@ref(chap:interactive-shiny-app) 章介绍交互式数据报表开发，符合工业标准的最佳实践。
